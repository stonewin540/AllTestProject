I used to properties to customize the CustomKeyboard.
    inputAccessoryView & inputView, are both property of UITextView.
    inputAccessoryView is a view above the keyboard,
    inputView is the view that to use to replace the system keyboard.

So, i add some button into the custom accessory view that to perform display different keyboard. And add some blah blah button into custom keyboard that for responding user input.
